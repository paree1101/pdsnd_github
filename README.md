### Date created
- I created the project _bikeshare.py_ on 25<sup>th</sup> February 2023
- I created the _README.md_ file on 14<sup>th</sup> March 2023


### Project Title
The project I worked on was < Explore US Bikeshare Data :statue_of_liberty: :bike:

### Description of my project
The project required me to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US:
- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington 

Using the language; Python I was supposed to create a code that could guide through questions like:
- Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
- Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
- If month is chosen then which month: January, February, March, April, May, or June
- If day is chosen then which day: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

### Files used
Here are the files containing all of the data for the 3 cities:
1) [Chicago](documents/pdsnd_github/.gitignore/chicago.csv)
2) [New York City](documents/pdsnd_github/.gitignore/new_york_city.csv)
3) [Washington](documents/pdsnd_github/.gitignore/washington.csv)
